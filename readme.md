## small react boilerplate

### run it:

1. npm i
2. npm run server
3. browse to localhost:3000


- no dependancies except react (and express but you could use http)

- uses small scripts either [1](https://gist.github.com/cauburtin/51e4ec99dc8ef5951706) for bundling on server-side, or [2](https://gist.github.com/cauburtin/cf82c451120373dc1568) (credits to its author) for bundling from client-side, the 2 modes are both handy in development
